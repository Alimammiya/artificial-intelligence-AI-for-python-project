## 5 habits every developer should adopt!

## 1. Don't repeat yourself

This habit is based on DRY.

The “Don't Repeat Yourself” principle is a software development practice aimed at reducing the repetition of information.

So when you have a piece of code that repeats in your codebase try to put that into a function.

## 2. Code every day

This is so important especially if you're learning how to code.

Typing some code for as little as 15 minutes every day can increase your skills a lot faster.

And by developing this habit you won't rely on motivation.

## 3. Never stop learning

Being a developer is a lifelong learning journey.

The worst thing you can do as a developer is to stop learning new technologies.

This field evolves so fast and you need to keep up with it.

## 4. Think before you write code

Don't just write code without having a solution in mind.

Start by thinking about the solution for the problem you want to solve and only after that start to write it.

This will save you a lot of time down the road.

## 5. Avoid burnout

Listen to your body.

When you feel like you need some rest take a break.

Burning out == at least a few weeks of no code.

A small break from time to time can help you avoid this.
