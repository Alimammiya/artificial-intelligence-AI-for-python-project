## Description

Have you never programmed in a computer before, and think or say that Java is a good programming language to start with. so you think right.

Maybe you have some good experience with other programming languages, but want to learn Java. This is a great language for your CV (Curriculum vitae).

Perhaps you are stuck in a low-paying programming job and want to move to a better, more senior position to learn Java programming, this might help you.

The fact is, learning to program in Java is not only an excellent programming language, to begin with, but it will make you better at other computer programming languages.

## Why learn Java?

Java is often considered the mother of OOPs languages ​​because many other languages ​​have been based on it.

Although Java is simple, it is one of the most powerful languages ​​ever created. Given that it was created 26 years ago, it is still heavily used and is generally one of the top 5 or 6 most popular and most widespread programming languages ​​in the world.

Learning Java programming can really make you stronger at programming in other languages ​​such as - C++, Python programming, or C#, which equip you with a mental model of the computer while running your programs.

By learning how things really work "under the hood" and understanding CPU architecture, memory space, and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and get a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.

If you want to be a better developer, Java is a great way to start learning!

It does not omit the course details. You'll learn how to write high-quality code and be an excellent problem solver. This course not only exists to code in the Java programming language, but it also includes all the details on the "why" you are doing. At the end of this course, you will be able to fully understand the concepts of the Java programming language.
