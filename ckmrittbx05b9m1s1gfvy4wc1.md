## 50 Cool Web And Mobile Project Ideas for 2021

A lot of people struggle when it comes to thinking of project ideas. Here is a list of 50 cool project ideas that you could build in 2021. I will even give you my technical stack as an example so you can figure out how you could do it too. These applications can be on the web, mobile and desktop. There is an unlimited choice of tools, technologies and programming languages that you could use to build them I am only showing some use cases here. Each project has a programming level of either beginner, intermediate or advanced. And these applications are created to be either front-end, back-end or full-stack.

My current technical stack is:

Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Redux, Flutter/Dart
Back-End: Python, Node.Js, SQL, NoSQL

## 1. Social Media Dashboard

This could be an app that combines many social media networks into one interface. So for example you could have Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram all together. That means only having one browser tab opened and one unified user interface.

__Programming Level__: Advanced
__Project Type__: Full-Stack   

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, Redux, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 2. Dating App Manager

An app that would make it easy for you to manage your dating life. Because these days many people tend to use multiple dating apps so it can be hard for you to keep track of the dates you have planned. With this type of app you could keep track of all of the people you are currently talking to as well as basic information such as names, phone numbers, where you met etc...

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 3. Computer Game Companion App

With this type of app you could essentially take your gaming experience with you. For example if you play a game like Fortnite you could build a mobile app that lets you track your stats. You could even have an inventory section for all of the emotes, weapons and accessories.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 4. Job Search App

How about creating a job search app that feels more like a dating app instead of the traditional serious looking job boards out there. So instead of doing the usual boring job application where you have to submit your CV and then wait for a generic email telling you that they received your application and will get back to you. You are instead given the ability to swipe if you think it's a match or not if you do not think so. Interaction with the hiring manager would feel so much more informal and casual. But of course there should be a way to limit interactions so it does not feel like spam and get overwhelming.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 5. 100DaysOfCode App

The 100DaysOfCode challenge helps people to commit to learning how to code consistently. Basically you just use the hashtag for 100DaysOfCode and then use Twitter to tweet your daily progress. At the moment there is no easy way to automatically keep track and schedule tweets for the hashtag. So you creating an app that automatically schedules the tweets as well as any media attached would be quite useful.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

## 6. Social Network for Mental Health

This global pandemic has affected almost everyone's mental health in some way or form. Creating a safe place where people can talk about it and share stories would be great. It's a way for people to get stuff off their chest while also connecting with people who can relate to their issues.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

__Programming Level__: Advanced
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

## 8. Fashion Design App 

Building a fashion design app that can create a personal style for you based on your personal choices and it gives you links to websites to purchase the clothing. With this concept it is essentially working as a personal style guide that works for you and gives you recommendations on what to buy which is fashionable for you.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

## 9. Dating Life Community App

Not everyone finds dating easy so how about building a dating life community app where people can talk and share resources on how to meet people and get into relationships. Talking about personal experiences as well as tips.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, TypeScript, React, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 10. Lost Animals App

This is a cool idea you could develop an app that lets you tag a location of where you found a lost animal. With this kind of app you could potentially share the location with someone who has lost an animal so that they could find it. As an addition having the location of the nearest clinic nearby could make it even easier to take them some place safe.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

## 11. A Review Website Aggregator

As developers it can sometimes be hard to find a good course because there are so many on the internet. So creating a review website aggregator that pulls in reviews from courses all over the internet would be amazing. You could filter and sort through the courses which would make it super easy to decide on a learning path.

__Programming Level__: Advanced
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, React Native
__Back-End__: Node.Js, NoSQL

## 12. A Random Website Generator

Unless you have a design background it can be quite hard to come up with a design for an app or website. So with that in mind creating a random website generator would be very cool. In this case it would just put a design together which you could then build using the programming language of your choice. Or if you are feeling up for a challenge you could turn it into a full fledged website builder too that even generates the code!

__Programming Level__: Advanced
__Project Type__: Full-Stack   

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
__Back-End__: Python, SQL

## 13. Dating App

The world is already full of dating apps but there is still no stand out app. They all have their pros and cons if you take a look at the reviews for them. So building a dating app that takes the best features of all apps while still remaining affordable or even free should persuade the masses to join.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate
__Project Type__: Full-Stack

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Flutter/Dart
__Back-End__: Node.Js, SQL

## 14. E-Commerce Website

__Programming Level__: Beginner
__Project Type__: Front-End   

__Front-End__: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
__Back-End__: N/A

## 16. Developer Freelance Platform

Similar to websites like Upwork and Fiverr however it is a platform that is ONLY for developers. It could be a platform that makes it easy for developers to find and connect with each other and work on projects together through collaboration. So you are not only getting fast and easy real world experience but you are also connecting with developers who are around your skill level. This would be a fantastic way to level up and an easy way for beginners to get work. I think it would be a good idea as it cuts out the recruiter completely and you don't need to stress over interviews. However there could be some form of onboarding and maybe tests depending on the work and the developers who work on it. These can be free open source projects or there can be some salary involved.

__Programming Level__: Intermediate

Even if you currently own it or if you sold it and whether it's digital or a physical copy.
