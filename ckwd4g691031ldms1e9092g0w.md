## Description

JavaScript is the most popular programming/coding language in the world. It powers the entire modern web. It provides millions of high-paying jobs in the world.

That's why you want to learn JavaScript too. And you came to the right place!

### Why This JavaScript Course Is Right for You?

*This is the complete JavaScript course provided by [Use My Notes](https://usemynotes.com/). It's an all-in-one course that will take you from the very fundamentals of JavaScript, all the way to building complex applications.*

You will learn modern JavaScript step by step from the very beginning. I'll walk you through practical and fun code examples and important principles of how JavaScript works behind the scenes.

You'll also learn how to think like a developer, how to plan application features, how to architect your code, how to debug code, and many other real-world skills you'll need in your developer job.

And unlike other courses, it really covers beginner, intermediate and advanced topics, so you don't need to buy any other courses to master JavaScript from the beginning!

But... you don't need to go into all these topics. This is a huge course because, after all, it is "The Complete JavaScript Course". In fact, it's like many courses in 1. But you can become an excellent developer only by learning certain parts of the curriculum. That's why I have designed this course in a very modular way and designed paths that will make you move faster in the course.

### So what exactly is covered in the course?
